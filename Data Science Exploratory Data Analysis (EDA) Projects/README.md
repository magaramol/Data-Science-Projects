# Data Science Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects

Welcome to the Data Science Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of my EDA projects in which I explore various datasets to uncover insights, visualize trends, and gain a deeper understanding of the data. Each project focuses on a different dataset.

## Projects

1. **[Retail Data Insights](./Retail Data Insights.ipynb/)**: Analyzing customer purchase history to understand behavior patterns and sales trends.
2. **[Climate Data Analysis with NetCDF Format](./climate_data/)**: Analyzing climate data stored in NetCDF format to understand climate patterns and changes.
3. **[Telecom Churn Analysis](./telecom_churn/)**: Analyzing factors contributing to customer churn in the telecom industry.
4. **[Kaggle Survey Exploration](./kaggle_survey/)**: Exploring the Kaggle survey dataset to understand trends in the data science and machine learning community.

## Usage

Feel free to explore each project folder to find the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb` file) for detailed analysis and visualization. To run the notebooks locally, set up a Python environment with the required libraries listed in the project's `requirements.txt` file.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add your own EDA projects to this repository, follow the provided steps in the main README.
